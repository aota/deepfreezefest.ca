## Message from the Honourable James Moore

Welcome to the 2013 Deep Freeze Byzantine Winter Festival.

Our Government understands how important arts and culture are to strengthening our communities and our economy. As we approach Canada’s 150th birthday celebrations in 2017, we are proud to invest in projects like this festival that contribute to our collective identity and define who we are as Canadians. Deep Freeze offers a rich program of events for residents and visitors to the Edmonton region and lets people of all ages and backgrounds revel in the magic and beauty of winter.

On behalf of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Government of Canada, I would like to thank Arts on the Ave Edmonton Society and all the organizers, performers, and volunteers who have helped bring this year’s Deep Freeze to life. Best wishes for a successful festival!

Sincerely,

_The Honourable James Moore_

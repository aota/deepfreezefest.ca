## Tourtière Baking Contest

**Registration deadline is Noon on January 4, 2016**

_Tourtière_ is a total comfort food, loved by all, and each year on **Francophone Day (Sunday)** at Deep Freeze Byzantine Winter Festival, we serve homemade, delicious Tourtière to hundreds of hungry, appreciative festival-goers. 

This year we invite YOU to come and show-off your secret _Tourtière_ recipe in our first ever Tourtière Baking Contest, taking place on Sunday, January 10, 2016.

Recipes for _Tourtière_ vary from region to region and kitchen to kitchen. It’s been said that the best recipe is the one your _grand-mère_ gave you.  

Take up the Tourtière Challenge and enter the Deep Freeze Tourtière Baking Contest!!

About _Tourtière_
French Canadian _Tourtière_ (meat pie), is served on _Reveillon_ (Christmas Eve). Each Christmas Eve, Quebecers traditionally headed to a beautiful candlelight church service and then drove home through the snow to enjoy a late supper of _Tourtière_ – Québec pork pie. This tradition is still fondly practiced throughout Québec, whether preceded by a religious service or not.


To register you may email: <deepfreezefranco@gmail.com>.

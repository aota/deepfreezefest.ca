### Fireworks Tribute to Don Snider

**Saturday at 6pm**

Don Snider was a leader in the Edmonton arts community for more than two decades. He was the Production Manager of the Edmonton Folk Music Festival, amongst others, and an integral part of fireworks shows in Edmonton; First Night, Canada Day and Deep Freeze Festival. Don loved the sound, the feeling, the colour and the joy on people’s faces when the boom would begin echoing through the sky. This is the second annual fireworks show dedicated to Don and the legacy of joy he has left us with. “Life is beautiful.”

### Olde Tyme Curling

The tradition continues as ice skating and curling are back on the Avenue. Don your wool sweater, do up your skates and brush off your broom. You can borrow skates (no cost) at the City of Edmonton Skate van. 

### Dutch Snow Sculptors

Deep Freeze welcomes Wilfred Stijger and Edith van de Wetering, from Katwijk, Netherlands. These two international snow sculptors travel the world transforming winter landscapes everwhere they go. We are excited to have them as our guests this year. In partnership with [Ice on Whyte](http://www.iceonwhyte.ca/). -->

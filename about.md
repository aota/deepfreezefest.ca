## Deep Freeze: A Byzantine Winter Festival

We are pleased to announce that the ninth-annual **Deep Freeze: Byzantine Winter Festival will be held on January 9 and 10, 2016** and will be situated along four closed blocks of Alberta (118) Avenue between 90 and 94 Streets. This winter adventure celebrates the Russian/Ukrainian “Olde New Year” and embraces the cold northern climate by melding artistic panache with authentic cultural and heritage winter games and fun.

The Deep Freeze Winter Festival is a free family event that brings together the Ukrainian, Franco-Albertan, Franco-African, First Nations, and Acadian/East Coast communities to revel in the magic and beauty of winter. This year’s theme **Fairyland: Fairies and Elves and Ogres...Oh My!!** will offer exciting opportunities for both patrons and artists creating unexpected experiences celebrating the community through its urban landscape and exceptional spaces.

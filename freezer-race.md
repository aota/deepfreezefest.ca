# Deep Freezer Race

## The most fun you can have with a Deep Freezer!

Yep – this is exactly what it sounds like: a Deep Freezer on skis, raced to a finish line. A huge hit in 2013, we’re very excited to bring this event back to Deep Freeze 2014!

Be sure to watch for the races behind the Alberta Avenue Community Centre between 12-2 pm on both Saturday January 11th and Sunday January 12th – you don’t want to miss this!

Or if you’re looking for a little excitement... [Register your team of five for a crazy fun time!](/whats-on/freezer-race/apply/)

# Deep Freezer Race

## The most fun you can have with a Deep Freezer!

Yep – this is exactly what it sounds like: a Deep Freezer on skis, raced to a finish line. A huge hit the past two years, we’re very excited to bring this event back to Deep Freeze 2015!

Be sure to watch for the races on both Saturday January 10 and Sunday January 10 – you don’t want to miss this!

Or if you’re looking for a little excitement... [Register your team of five for a crazy fun time!](/whats-on/freezer-race/apply/)

## Heart & Soul

Volunteers are the heart and soul of Arts on the Ave. Hundreds of volunteers celebrate and create new traditions together on Alberta Avenue. Their tireless efforts make our festivals and community an inspiring piece of Edmonton’s cultural fabric. Join the revolution and inspire change through volunteering, read on!

## This year's theme

The theme this year is **Fairyland: Fairies and Elves and Ogres...Oh My!!** We’ll be bringing dance, theatre, music, film, galleries, deepfreezer races, ethnic food, ice and snow sculptures, fireworks and winter sport to Alberta Ave!

We are in need of volunteer elves to help round up the crowds – outdoor, indoor, before, during, after. Take your pick! Also need ogres (security), sprites (information ambassadors), and fairies (team leaders) ushers and gnomes (fire watchers).

For more information please email <deepfreezevolunteers@gmail.com>

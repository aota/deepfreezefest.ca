## Arts of Life Studio of Edmonton invites everyone to experience Malanka on Jan 10!

Arts of Life Studio of Edmonton invites everyone to experience Malanka - Ukrainian folk holiday celebrated on January 13th, which is New Year's Eve in accordance with the Julian calendar. We invite everyone to carol with us and to participate in our Koza games and dances.

On this night in Ukraine, carolers go from house to house playing pranks and acting out a small play: The Goat Koza. A traditional mimetic folk play that is acted out during the Christmas cycle by young men and women, who visited all the houses in a village. The Goat - a youth wearing an inverted sheepskin coat and a mask - enters a house, bows to the head of the household, and performs a dance to bring about an abundant harvest. The other youths sing an accompanying ditty: De Koza khodyt’, tam zhyto rodyt’, de Koza tup-tup, tam zhyta sim kup (Where the Goat goes, there wheat grows; where the Goat stamps its feet, there are seven sheaves of wheat). The original purpose of Koza was the same as that of carols: to invoke a successful year for the household as well as fun and entertainment. Occasionally, the Goat is accompanied by others in costumes of an Old Man, Gypsies, Malanka (the New Year's Eve maiden), the Bear, and other characters. The original purpose of Koza was the same as that of carols: to invoke a successful year for the household as well as fun and entertainment.

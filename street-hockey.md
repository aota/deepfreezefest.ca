# Street Hockey Tournament

## The best darn-tootin’ Street Hockey Tourney is back!

The Deep Freeze Street Hockey Tournament is back and bigger than ever! We’ve doubled our rinks to 4, added a warm up rink and an awesome Skills Competition on Sunday January 13th! The top four teams win dinner for up to 20 people at the Canadian Brewhouse.

Recruit your friends and family to team-up for a friendly afternoon street hockey tournament over the festival weekend on 118th Avenue. Teams must be a minimum of 4 (3 players, 1 goalie), to a maximum of 7. Team captains register your team early as space is limited!

Please don’t hesitate to email Dan at <deepfreezehockey@gmail.com> with any questions.

**We’re also looking for volunteers for the Tournament** including referees for both days, as well as a couple helpers to assist with set up and tear down. If you’re interested in any of these opportunities, contact Heidi at <deepfreezevolunteers@gmail.com> to sign up.
